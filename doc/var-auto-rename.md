## Automatic renaming local and global variables, struct members
The first thing I've seen very annoying when begins reverse a lot - I spend too much time for renaming variables which can be renamed automatically. So there is AutoRenamer has been implemented with following rules:
* Good-Name-Sources are:
	- user named global/local variable, struct member
	- user or library named arguments of called subroutine.
	- string literal, "helper" name
	- comment is not started from ';' letter
	- number in range: `1 < const_val < 0x80000000` produce name like `n111`
	- number in `enum` form
	- call to procedure with following name (`A`/`W` letters and additions like `_2` in the end of proc name are ignored):
		+ `GetLastError` produce name `err`
		+ function with name contains `get` substring. Example: `SomeClass::getSomething()` or `SomeClass::get_Something()` produce name: `Something`
		+ function with name contains `::ctor` substring. Example: `SomeClass::ctor_copy()` produce name: `SomeClass`
		+ `LoadLibrary(LibName)`, `GetModuleHandle(LibName)` and `dlopen(LibName)` produce name: `hLibName`
		+ `GetProcAddress(hMod, ProcName)` and `dlsym(hMod, ProcName)` produce name: `ProcName`
		+ `strdup(Arg)`, `wcsdup(Arg)` produce name: `Arg`
		+ `????code_pointer(Arg)` and `??codePointer(Arg)` produce name: `Arg`
	- for reference prepended Good-Name like
		+ `&X_` produce name `X` (last '_' symbol stripped)
		+ `&X`  produce name `p_X` ('p_' inserted)
	- dereference pointer like `*p_X` produce name `X` ('p_' stripped)
* Bad-Name-Sources are:
	- names like: `var_XX`, `arg_XX`, `varXX`, `argXX`, `aXX`, `vXX`, `a_XX`, `v_XX`, `vXa`, where `XX` one or two digits
	- CPU register names with optional numeric suffix (like `ecx0`)
	- struct member with name `VT` / `__vftable` or name begins from `field_`, `fld_`, `gap`
  - case sensitive names optionally prefixed with `lp` : `inited`, `started`, `result`, `Mem`, `Memory`, `Block`, `String`, `ProcName`, `ProcAddress`, `LibFileName`, `ModuleName`, `LibraryA`, `LibraryW`
	- function arguments: `this`, `Str`, `Src`, `Dst`, `dwBytes`, `Flink`, `Blink`
* For the assignment operator like `A = B;` where one of side is a Good-Name-Source and another is unnamed (Bad-Name-Source) variable or struct member, bad-named part is renamed to `NameSource_XX` where `XX` is one or two digits
* Same for relation ops like `A == B`, `A < B`, etc 
* On renaming referenced variable or struct member like `&Var`
	- `p_X` as new name became `X` (`p_` is stripped)
	- `X` as new name became `X_`  (last '_' symbol appended)
* On renaming dereferenced variable or struct member like `*Var`  where Var has scalar type 
  - `X` as new name became `p_X`  ('p_' inserted)
* `strcpy(A,B)`, `wcscpy(A,B)`, `lstrcpy(A,B)`, `qmemcpy(A,B)` considered as `A = B;` assignment
* `call(a1, a2, ...)` with typeinfo `func(p1, p2, ...)` considered as series of assignments `p1 = a1;` `p2 = a2;` etc...
* call of proc with name like `off_xxx` (usually appears at IAT in debugger session) is renamed to destination of this `off_xxx`
* wrapper (thunk) proc with only one call `subproc(...)` statement inside, is renamed to `subproc_w`. ("_w" suffix is appended to the name)

Additionally AutoRenamer does name and type info propagation across call graph:
- current function type may be updated by auto-renaming of variable corresponding to the function argument
- if call's argument has name and the called function has not: type and name of argument will be propagated into called function type (only if count of x-refs to such func is not greater five to avoid renaming args in popular funcs like `memcpy`, `alloc`, etc).

>üìù **Note:** sometimes AutoRenamer too aggressively propagates a wrong, meaningless name. To fix it just rename one of them to correct and kill other with "N"-"Del"-"Enter". Then propagate new correct name by pressing "F5"
